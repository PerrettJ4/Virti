1. Dificulty with error code: 'ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED'
-> installed the latest version of postcss
2. Finding correct usage of onTimeChange, and setting state
-> This may result in some delay in the images but only minimal.
3. I started of thinking I could create a re-usable image component, however handing down currentTime as a prop caused infinite re-rendering
3. I then thought of using a switch which would take in a argument from each of the images (1,2,3..) but then I realised this would be inefficient, and that the only dependant variable was time.
-> So I changed tactic to a external Switch which is almost a timeline for the video (re-factoring is neccesary)
4. i am going to add a table fopr counting the occurences and times! chnage color on hover of things, and also the runaway button.
5. Having a recurring error that getBOUNDINGCLIENTRECT() IS RETURNing null on page opening. Going to try and remove the logic from inline.
-> managed to fix it and that was super easy! however, for some reason, my button does not come back to the other side of the screen when disappering :s
